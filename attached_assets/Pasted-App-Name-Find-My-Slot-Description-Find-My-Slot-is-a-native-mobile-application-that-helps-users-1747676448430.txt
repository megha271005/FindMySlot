App Name: Find My Slot

Description:
Find My Slot is a native mobile application that helps users find, book, and manage parking slots in real time. The app uses GPS to detect the user’s current location and shows available parking slots nearby. Slot availability is synced in real time from physical sensors to a backend database. Users can book slots weekly with fixed pricing per time block, pay online, receive notifications about slot availability, and manage their bookings via a dashboard. An admin interface allows managing slots, pricing, and monitoring sensor data.
